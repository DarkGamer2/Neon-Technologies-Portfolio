            I am a 23-year-old technology enthusiast with a strong passion for
            coding and creative design. My love for programming drives me to
            build innovative projects, including games, apps, and websites. I
            have a well-rounded skill set that extends beyond coding, as I also
            enjoy 3D modeling, video editing, Photoshop, and sound design for
            games. These interests allow me to blend creativity with technical
            proficiency, which is something I truly enjoy. In my spare time, Iâ€™m
            an avid gamer and always stay up-to-date with the latest trends in
            gaming and technology.
